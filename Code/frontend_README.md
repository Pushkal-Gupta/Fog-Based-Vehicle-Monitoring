# Frontend Layer

## Overview

The frontend layer provides the **visualization and observability interface** for the Fog-Based Vehicle Monitoring System. It presents a real-time and historical view of vehicle health, alerts, and system status through dashboards and digital twin representations.

This layer has **no control authority** and does not participate in safety or decision-making logic.

---

## Role in the System

The frontend acts as the **human-facing window** into the system. It translates structured data produced by the fog and backend layers into intuitive visual representations for drivers, operators, or fleet managers.

Its purpose is **visibility and understanding**, not intervention.

---

## Core Responsibilities

- Displaying live vehicle health indicators
- Visualizing alerts, faults, and severity levels
- Presenting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimates
- Showing historical trends and summaries
- Rendering a digital twin of vehicle state

---

## Data Sources

The frontend consumes data from:

- Backend REST or streaming APIs
- Event summaries generated by the fog layer
- Aggregated historical records

All data received by the frontend is **read-only**.

---

## Displayed Information

Typical frontend views include:

- Subsystem health dashboards
- Alert and fault timelines
- Degradation and lifecycle trends
- Vehicle-level health scores
- Maintenance recommendations

---

## Non-Responsibilities

The frontend explicitly does **not**:

- Perform safety or fault decisions
- Trigger actuation or control commands
- Modify system thresholds or logic
- Communicate directly with hardware

All authoritative decisions occur upstream.

---

## Execution Environment

- Web-based or mobile-compatible interface
- Runs in standard browser or client environments
- Communicates only with backend services

---

## Design Principles

- Observability over control
- Clarity over complexity
- Real-time insight without authority
- Visual transparency of system state

---

## Summary

The frontend layer provides a **clear, real-time view of vehicle health and system behavior**, enabling informed monitoring while preserving strict separation from safety-critical logic.
